# dand-p2-statistics
Statistics project from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

This project uses descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology.

The Stroop Effect refers to the interference in the reaction time of a task. In this experiment, particpants are asked to read the names of colours that are printed on a piece of paper. When the name of the colour does not match the ink that the colour is printed in, participants are slower to read the correct colour name. So for example, a participant is likley to take longer to read the word "blue" if it was printed in red ink as opposed to blue ink.

In this project, I determine the independant and dependent variables, establish the null and alternative hypothesis, and perform a two-tailed dependant t-test to determine the mean, standard deviation, t-statistic and p-value.

The results are as follows: <br>
Mean Difference = -7.96 <br>
Standard Deviation = 4.84

This results in a t-statistic of -8.021, and a corresponding p value of less than 0.0001. When compared to the t-critical value, the calculated t-statistic is beyond the tcritical value. As a result we reject the null.

This result is in line with the initial observations. It took statistically significantly less time to complete the word set for a congruent sample versus an incongruent sample.
